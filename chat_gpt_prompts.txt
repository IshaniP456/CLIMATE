What are the trends for apparent temparature, wet bulb temperature and heat index

Assume that the values of the Monthly-Maximum_Temparature-STDDEV colum are the standard deviations of maximum temparature. What is the standard deviation of maximum temparature each month ?

This is not correct. The number of days in a year cannot exceed 365

Corelate the homicide rates in Mississipi between 2014 and 2022 with the number of unusually warm days between 2014 and 2022 computed above

For each day of each year between 2014 and 2022 compute the difference between dry bulb temparature in farenheit and the historical apparent temparature for the month the day belongs to then find out if it is greater than one standard deviation for the month. If it is greater than one standard deviation then that day is unusually warm.  Following this methodology calculate how many days of each year between 2014 and 2022 were unsually warm.
